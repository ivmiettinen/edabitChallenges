// Mubashir was walking through a straight street with exactly n identical houses on both sides. House numbers in the street look like this:

// He noticed that Even numbered houses increase on the right while Odd numbered houses decrease on the left.

// Create a function that takes a house number house and length of the street n and returns the house number on the opposite side.

const oppositeHouse = (house, length) => {
    
 
    return length*2+1-house }


oppositeHouse(3, 5)

oppositeHouse(23633656673, 310027696726)
